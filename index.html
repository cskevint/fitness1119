            <h3>Derek Johnson</h3>
            <p>"The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking." ~Albert Einstein</p>
            <p>I am fortunate to be able to spend my life helping others change theirs. Every morning I know my day will be filled with improving the quality of life for someone else. As a personal trainer, I am expected to help my clients reach their fitness goals but to me it is more than that. I accept the responsibility to affect spiritual as well as physical change in EVERY individual that crosses my path.</p>
            <p>Captivated by my first workout in a gym more than 30 years ago I now use the gym and fitness training programs as a platform to share, promote and teach a positive and inspiring life style. I thrive on the knowledge that I have something to give that can change the world!</p>
            <p>When not in the gym, I have shared my passion with young adults on the softball field for more than a decade in the Bay Area. As the head coach for varsity softball at Saint Ignatius College Preparatory in San Francisco and Cal Nuggets Softball, I use the same approach of physical training and spiritual awareness to prepare my student athletes for a high level of competition in addition to personal empowerment in life after their softball careers are over.</p>
            <p>My travels have taken me from the ocean floor as a certified rescue scuba diver to strategy sessions at Silicon Valley start-ups. I have acquired a passion for life on the mats of martial art dojos and passed that passion on across corporate sales floors. I have advised corporate executives and I have learned a lesson or two from 9-year-old girls on the softball field.</p>
            <p>Today…I am committed to having a positive impact on your life!</p>
            <p>Professionally my certifications include<br/>
                Personal Fitness Trainer - National Exercise and Sports Trainers Association<br/>
                Sports Performance Coach – USA Weightlifting<br/>

            <h3>John Fernandez</h3>
            <p>I use a Cross Circuit Training program designed for universal scalability making it the perfect application for any committed individual regardless of experience. I’ve used my same routines for elite athletes to grandparents. I scale load and intensity; I don’t change programs unless I am approached by a client with orthopedic, injury, and rehabilitation concerns. Otherwise, the needs of our grandparents and elite athletes differ by degree not kind.</p>
            <p>The basic premise is that it does not matter what your goals are or what you need, we will work hard as a team to make sure you reach those goals now rather than later. I realize that getting results is the only thing that matters. Well, if results is what you want rest assured RESULTS is what you will achieve.</p>
            <p>In addition to my 20 years of practical training experience I presently hold multiple certifications and specializations. Each of the certification groups offer courses and testing in subjects including anatomy, exercise physiology,kinesiology, biomechanics, range of motion, structural integrity, fitness screening and testing, training principles and techniques, understanding equipment, sport nutrition, sports injury, physician interfacing, sport psychology and motivation, safety and injury prevention. To be certified by these organizations requires rigorous study, participation in courses, hands-on training trials, and passing difficult examinations.</p>
